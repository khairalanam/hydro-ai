## HYDRO-AI : AI Powered Water Quality Monitoring
![HydroAI](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airtel.in%2Fblog%2Fbusiness%2Fiot-based-smart-water-quality-monitoring-and-control-system%2F&psig=AOvVaw2PIhspslJepakhYNPZ-URq&ust=1699129915183000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCJD9oanWqIIDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) 
Our project aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence to monitor and maintain the quality of water sources. We have developed an integrated system that utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to continuously analyze and assess various water quality parameters, including pH levels, contaminants, and temperature. The real-time monitoring system is equipped with sensors placed in strategic locations to provide accurate data. When deviations from acceptable water quality standards are detected, the system triggers alerts and notifications for prompt response and corrective action. By implementing this technology, we contribute to the preservation of our environment and the sustainable management of vital water resources.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
